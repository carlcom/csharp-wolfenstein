# README

I was looking for a project with Blazor and noticed (https://www.jamesdrandall.com/posts/csharp_blazor_wolfenstein_part_1/) and thought it would fun code to practice with. I am currently bringing the functionality from the F# version to the C# version. After that, I will make use of Blazor and SignalR to make the game online multiplayer :)

My goal is to showcase Blazor and my coding. I am using VS2022 and .NET8
